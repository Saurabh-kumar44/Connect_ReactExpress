Now we need to connec React with Express so, if the data of Express can come up inside the React app
then it means the React is Connected with the Express.
to do so, we can use either:
-fetch api
-axios(we gonna use it)(through the express Api(that we created))

1 error- localhost/:1 Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/api/student' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
-this error occure due to the CORS policy so to fix it (install cors from npm INSIDE EXPRESS)
